Multilayer Perceptron on MNIST

CNN

Data for CNN obtained from

Char-level LSTM for NMT forked from :
Requires LOTS of data to train from for real-world use.

A variational autoencoder that hallucinates MNIST data after being trained on MNIST data.(conditionally and unconditionally)
(The layers here work for B&W images. Add Conv2D layers for encoder and decoder(as in CNN) for non B&W image generation)
